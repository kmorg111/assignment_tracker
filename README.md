# Assignment Tracker

This program uses Tkinter to create a Python GUI where users can input details about their coursework. The program then compiles this data (sorted by due date/time) and writes it into an Excel file, creating a virtual planner for the user. The objective of this program is to make academic data (i.e. scheduling, course progress) easier to track and maintain, which, in turn, helps foster student success.

The base code for this program is derived from the following GitHub repo: [codefirstio/tkinter-data-entry](https://github.com/codefirstio/tkinter-data-entry.git)
